### Code for the manuscript evaluating different computational methods for non-canonical ORF prediction.

- 01: Preprocess and ORF prediction for the main banchmark dataset composed of 15 Ribo-Seq libraries.
- 02: Tidy MS-detected ORFs reported in previous studies.
- 03: Analysis of the main dataset.
- 04: Analysis of random splits of Ribo-Seq libraries in the main dataset.
- 05: ORF prediction and analysis of additional datasets with mulitple biological replicates.

Note: Soure of published datasets analyzed were described in the manuscript. Custom scripts used in the analyses were available from the `src` directory.
