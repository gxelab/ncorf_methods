### Code for the manuscript evaluating different computational methods for non-canonical ORF prediction.

- 01: Raw data preprocessing and ORF prediction.
- 02: Tidy MS-detected ORFs reported in previous studies.
- 03: Analysis of the main dataset with matched TI-Seq libraries.
- 04: Analysis of random splits of Ribo-Seq libraries in the main dataset and additional datasets with mulitple biological replicates.

Note: Soure of published datasets analyzed were described in the manuscript. Custom scripts used in the analyses were available from the `src` directory.
